# Project Title: Creating a Structured Dataset for YouTube Channels to Analyze Scientific Data Related to Social Sciences
This project is created as part of the Application Project course in the Data Engineering and Analytics M.Sc. program at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). The project, including all materials and code, was developed to further academic knowledge and is intended for educational and research purposes. It is done under the supervision of the Chair of Computational Social Science at TUM, with the application area being Computational Social Science. The project is titled "Creating a Structured Dataset for YouTube Channels to Analyze Scientific Data Related to Social Sciences," with Prof. Dr. Jürgen Pfeffer as the examiner and Anahit Sargsyan as the supervisor.

# Project Description:

YouTube offers a great platform for exploring sociocultural dynamics through user-generated content. In this project, we aim to use our Data Engineering and Analytics skills to answer important research questions in the field of Computational Social Science by building a well-organized and structured dataset from YouTube channels. Our goal is to process and organize large amounts of data efficiently using tools like Python and Pandas.

The main focus of our project is to gather detailed data from a wide range of YouTube channels. This includes important information such as the channels' IDs, names, descriptions, and links, as well as specific details about the videos, like their publication dates, titles, descriptions, number of views, and likes. Since YouTube has a large amount of content, we may apply sampling methods if needed. To collect this data, we’ll use YouTube’s API with tools like PyTube and scrapeTube, and rely on web scraping when the API has limitations.

This structured dataset will be a valuable resource, not just for academic work in the M.Sc. program, but also for research in areas like media studies, sociology, and data science. With careful guidance and attention to detail, this project will provide a useful foundation for analyzing social dynamics on YouTube.
